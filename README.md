# WeatherForcast
Ever wonder what the weather was like all the way in Taipei? Or in Rome? Or even outside your very own window?

I have created a weather application that gives you the information you need to step out the door and go on an adventure!

# What it does
Here's how it works. You type in whatever city it is you want to look up the weather for. The application with give you the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index with a color code. It'll even give you an icon for what the majority of the day should be like!

It will also give you the weather for the next five days so that you can plan out a few days in advance if that's your thing. The UI is constantly being improved so if there are a few stylistic things that you are not a fan of, I'm working on it. 

# The works
The application is mostly powered through javaScript. There are some HTML elements and some CSS so that it looks usable. Your city search should look like below. 

Enjoy!
